## 🔍 Quick Status Update

### ✅ What's Fixed
The app now properly retrieves and displays cases from the database!

### 📊 Current Status
- **Dashboard 139 (Khoros Classic Community)**: 254 cases in database
- **Dashboard 143 (Khoros Aurora)**: 2 cases in database  
- **Case #60144273**: Successfully stored and should be visible

### 🎯 About the Aurora Case

You mentioned: *"there is one case for Aurora"*

**Question:** Which case are you referring to?
- Do you know the ticket number?
- Or should I search for all open Aurora cases assigned to you?

### 💡 Next Steps

**Option A:** If you know the ticket number, tell me and I'll fetch it immediately!

**Option B:** I can search for open tickets using this JQL:
```
project = KAYAKO AND status = Open AND product = "Khoros Aurora"
```

### 🌐 Check Your Browser Now!

Go to **http://localhost:8080** and click **"Start Monitoring"**

You should see cases appearing now! The database shows:
- 254 cases for Khoros Classic Community
- 2 cases for Khoros Aurora

**Note:** These might be old test cases. If you want to see only REAL current cases, I can:
1. Clear the database
2. Fetch fresh open cases from Kayako
3. Push them to the app

What would you like me to do?
