3. **✅ Started the service** on http://localhost:8080
4. **✅ Tested with mock data** - worked perfectly!
5. **✅ Fetched REAL case #60144273** from Kayako using MCP
6. **✅ Pushed it to your browser** - it should be visible now!

## 🔄 How to Add More Cases

### Method 1: Ask Me!
Just say: **"Fetch open cases from Kayako dashboard 143"**

I'll:
1. Use the MCP to fetch cases
2. Push them to your Flask app
3. They appear instantly in your browser!

### Method 2: Automatic Script (I can build this for you)
I can create a Python script that:
- Runs every 60 seconds
- Fetches open cases from specific dashboards
- Automatically pushes them to the app
- You get real-time notifications!
